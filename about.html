   <center><h1>ABOUT CHEETAHS</h1>
   <h3>
    The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. 
    <br>
    It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail.
    <br>
    It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3.6 and 4.9 ft). 
    <br>
    Adults weigh between 20 and 65 kg (44 and 143 lb). 
    <br>
    Its head is small, rounded, and has a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. 
    <br>
    The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. 
    <br>
    Four subspecies are recognised.
<br>
<br>

 <h2> The cheetah lives in three main social groups, females and their cubs, male "coalitions" and solitary males. 
   <br>
While females lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges, males are more sedentary and may instead establish much smaller territories in areas with plentiful prey and access to females. 
    <br>
The cheetah is active mainly during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk.
<br>
It feeds on small- to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and Thomson's gazelles.
    <br>
The cheetah typically stalks its prey to within 60–70 m (200–230 ft), charges towards it, trips it during the chase and bites its throat to suffocate it to death.
<br>
It breeds throughout the year. After a gestation of nearly three months, a litter of typically three or four cubs is born. 
     <br>
Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores such as hyenas and lions. 
   <br>
They are weaned at around four months and are independent by around 20 months of age.
