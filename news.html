   <center><h1>NEWS ON CHEETAHS</h1>
  <h3>Nearly 70 years after the cheetah was declared locally extinct or extirpated, India will receive its first batch of the large cats from Africa by the end of this year. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Within a week’s time, two expert teams — one from Namibia and the other from South Africa — the two countries with the highest cheetah populations in the world, will arrive to train Indian forest officers and wildlife experts on handling, breeding, rehabilitation, medical treatment and conservation of the animals.
<br>
<br>
    This is the first time in the world that a large carnivore will be relocated from one continent to another.
    <br>
    <br>
    The animal is believed to have disappeared from the country when Maharaja Ramanuj Pratap Singh Deo of Koriya hunted and shot the last three recorded Asiatic cheetahs in India in 1947.
   <br>
   <br>
    It was declared extinct by the government in 1952.
